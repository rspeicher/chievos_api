# Chievos API ![](http://stillmaintained.com/tsigo/chievos_api.png)

Abandoned project. I was aiming to provide a nice JSON API to Xbox.com
achievement data. I lost interest because secret achievements suck.

The way secret achievements work is that you can't see their name, description
or icon unless you've unlocked them yourself. So with the account I used to
crawl the xbox.com site in this project, it hadn't actually played any games,
and secrets stayed secret.

This code could still be useful if you could justify making people log in with
their xbox.com credentials just so you could populate secret achievement data.
If enough prolific achievement whores aided in the crawling you could reveal
enough to be meaningful.

## Learning!

On each new project I try to use something I haven't before, and in the case of
this project, that was Ohm and Redis, and Padrino.
